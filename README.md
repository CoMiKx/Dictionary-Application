# Dictionary-Application
This Dictionary Application is a simple, console-based C++ program that allows users to search for the definitions of English words. The application loads a dictionary from a text file, where each entry consists of a word, its type (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), and its definition. Users can search for words in an interactive menu-driven interface.
